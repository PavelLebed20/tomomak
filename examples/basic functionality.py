# This is an example of a basic framework functionality.
# You will learn how to use framework, steps you need to follow in order to get the solution.
# More advanced features are described in advanced examples.

# The first step is to create coordinate system. We will consider 2D cartesian coordinates.
# Let's create coordinate mesh. First axis will consist of 20 segments. Second - of 30 segments.
# This means that solution will be described by the 20x30 array.
axes = [cartesian.Axis1d(name="X", units="cm", size=20, upper_limit=10),
        cartesian.Axis1d(name="Y", units="cm", size=30, upper_limit=10)]
mesh = mesh.Mesh(axes)
# Now we can create Model.
# Model is one of the basic tomomak structures which stores information about geometry, solution and detectors.
# At present we only have information about the geometry.
mod = model.Model(mesh=mesh)
# Now let's create synthetic 2D object to study.
# We will consider triangle.
real_solution = objects2d.polygon(mesh, [(1, 1), (4, 8), (7, 2)])
# Model.solution is the solution we are looking for.
# It will be obtained at the end of this example.
# However, if you already know supposed solution (for example you get it with simulation),
# you can use it as first approximation by setting Model.solution = *supposed solution*.
# Recently we've generated test object, which is, of course, real solution.
# A trick to visualize this object is to temporarily use it as model solution.
mod.solution = real_solution
mod.plot2d()
# You can also make 1D plot. In this case data will be integrated over 2nd axis.
mod.plot1d(index=0)
# After we've visualized our test object, it's time to set model solution to None and try to find this solution fairly.
mod.solution = None

# Next step is to provide information about the detectors.
# Let's create 15 fans with 22 detectors around the investigated object.
# Each line will have 1 cm width and 0.2 Rad divergence.
# Note that number of detectors = 330 < solution cells = 600, so it's impossible to get perfect solution.
det = detectors2d.fan_detector_array(mesh=mesh,
                                     focus_point=(5, 5),
                                     radius=11,
                                     fan_num=15,
                                     line_num=22,
                                     width=1,
                                     divergence=0.2)
# Now we can calculate signal of each detector.
# Of course in the real experiment you measure detector signals so you don't need this function.
det_signal = signal.get_signal(real_solution, det)
mod.detector_signal = det_signal
mod.detector_geometry = det
# Let's take a look at the detectors geometry:
mod.plot2d(data_type='detector_geometry')
# It's also possible to get short model summary by converting the model object to string.
print(mod)

# The next step is optional. You can perform transformation with existing geometry,
# e.g. switch to another coordinate system or to basic function space.
# Convenient way to do this is to use pipeline. Once pipeline is created,
# you can do transformations using forward() method.
# And if you wish to perform backward transformation later, you can use backward() method.
# let's rescale our model to 20x20 cells. Rescale class performs transformation to the
# keeps axes types but changes number of segments. If the axis is irregular, rescaling take it into account.
pipe = pipeline.Pipeline(mod)
r = rescale.Rescale((20, 20))
pipe.add_transform(r)
# Our real solution should also be changed, so we need to use same trick again.
mod.solution = real_solution
pipe.forward()
real_solution = mod.solution
mod.plot2d()
mod.solution = None
# The rescaling is successful.
# If you want to switch to previous 20x30 cells case just use pipe.backward(). Note that you will lost

# Now let's find the solution. In order to do so we need to create solver.
solver = Solver()
# We can easily track different statistics. Let's track residual norm and Chi^2 statistics.
# When the calculations are over you can plot the results or find statistical value at each step
# in "data" attribute of each object, e.g. in solver.statistics[0].data
solver.statistics = [statistics.RN(), statistics.RMS()]
# RMS need to know real solution in order to perform calculations.
solver.real_solution = real_solution

# Finally, let's choose method, we would like to use in order to find the solution.
# We start with  maximum likelihood method.
solver.iterator = ml.ML()
# Let's do 50 steps and see resulted image and statistics.
steps = 50
solver.solve(mod, steps=steps)
mod.plot2d()
solver.plot_statistics()

# Now let's change to  algebraic reconstruction technique.
solver.iterator = algebraic.ART()
# We can also add some constraints. This is important in the case of limited date reconstruction.
# For now let's assume that all values are positive. Note that ML method didn't need this constraint,
# since one of it's features is to preserve solution sign.
solver.constraints = [tomomak.constraints.basic.Positive()]
# It's possible to choose early stopping criteria for our reconstruction.
# In this example we want residual mean square error to be < 15 %.
# In the real world scenario you will not know real solution,
# so you will use other stopping criterias, e.g. residual norm.
solver.stop_conditions = [statistics.RMS()]
solver.stop_values = [15]
# Also we should limit number of steps in the case it's impossible to reach such accuracy.
steps = 10000
# Finally, let's make decreasing step size. It will start from 0.1 and decrease a bit at every step.
solver.iterator.alpha = np.linspace(0.1, 0.01, steps)
# And here we go:
solver.solve(mod, steps=steps)
mod.plot2d()
solver.plot_statistics()

# And that's it. You get solution, which is, of course, not perfect,
# but world is not easy when you work with the limited data.
# There are number of ways to improve your solution, which will be described in other examples.
